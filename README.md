# NFL_Annual_Passing_Stats
Credit to Pro Football Reference for the data. The theme of this project is just the passing stats in the NFL over the years. Here, I'll look at 3 particular data sets related to the same subject: 1) Passing League Average per Team Game, 2)  Passing League Average Per Team Season, and 3)  Passing League Totals. The point of this project is just to give a visualization of the evolution of the passing game in the NFL, not to show what variable contribute to it as most of those factors are qualitative such as rule changes that obviously benefit the passing game and new breakthroughs in game planning/coordination; things that can't really be accounted for in data. Aside from the visualizations, I wanted to create 3 small but fun regression models using the main three data sets to predict how the passing game might continue to evolve in the future. The models used for these are cubic regression and linear regression, both which can be called by simply using lm() in R.
